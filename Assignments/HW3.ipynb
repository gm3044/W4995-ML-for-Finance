    "### The answer is yes, and my reasonings are below:\n",
    "### 1. Exhibits 1 and 2 (of the case) have clearly provided us with concrete evidences for the benefits of implementing momentum strategy comparing to that of \"market portfolio\"  using back tests.  The big picture question then becomes wherther or not AQR could develop a momentum stratgy without using a short position which is prohibited by the regulation of mutual funds. For example, whether or not  a backtest using repeatly rebalancing of the top 33 percentiles of the 1000 US stocks (large cap) can consistently beat the market portolio (such as SP500). The case mentioned that their large-cap momentum strategy outperform Russell 1000 growth index by 3.2 percent per year over the same period tells us that this is a pass for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. If the big picture is clear, then the remaining question becomes how to balance between sticking to the exact momentum strategy and pragmatic benefits of not doing so in practise (e.g., the example discussed in the case where XYZ should be replaced by ABC but with marginal benefits to do so). In my view, profolio manager should develop flexible plans for marginal differences based on emperical performances. For instance, if the ranking of certain stocks at the end is between (325 - 350 +- 50) of period2 1 and 2 and if the tax and return benefits outweight swap stocks XYZ for ABC, then they should not do so.\n",
    "### 3. Some other potential outperform indicators should also be taken into considration since momentum funds is the main feature but should not be the only feature.\n"

    "### My andser is yes. To partially support my assertion, I consider a Fama-French multi-factor regression below using \"High-low\" portfolio as the dependent variable and \" Premium\",\t\"HML\",\t\"SMB\", and\t\"UMD\" as independent variables. If UMD turns out to generate returns over the past few decades consistantly statistically significantly different from zero, we might very likely to expect this phenomena over the next decede. \n",

    "### How do we interpret it? It means 1% increase of UMD factor will be associated with 1.43% increase of the \"High-low\" momentum portfolio, and since the standard error is 0.102, the t-test is 13.991 which is a lot larger than the 0.05 threhold(1.96), meaning we can reject the null hypothesis (H_o = UMD has null effect) at the 1 percent signficant level.\n",
